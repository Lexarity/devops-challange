I've had many troubles throughout this challange due to me not being proficient in those areas:

dynamodb has been a strugle at the start to actually connect to - i thought i needed to connect through aws in order
to acess the db till i found out i can connect through code to the data base

i was struggling at the start with docker due to not 100% understanding the purpose of it and what am i supposed to do.
didn't realize for a while that it wasn't even working due to not downloading something they wanted me to download.
after making the docker desktop app work and build a container it was a fairly hard time to actually build and run 
through java so i've had to learn that aswell. and after i've learned how to build and run through java for a major part
of the challange the docker container didn't work at all.

drone was really difficult for me because i couldn't really do much about it since there wasn't that much data online
about my problem.

github was a fairly new experience for me - pretty much the first time i've had to use it and it was a bit difficult
understanding what it's meaning, how to commit and everything around it and again with drone.

overall it was a very difficult and challanging experience but also a fun and learning experience which i mostly enjoyed. it really has given me a whole new experience and view of something i haven't seen before.

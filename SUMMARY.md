First of all i've had to install all the required assets in order for me to begin the challange. after i installed all the required assets i've began to go by the steps to complete the challange. i've started learning about dynamicdb and awws and how to get the secret code from the database using only the keys, table name and the region. after i've completed that, i went on to get myself to learn the docker and how to use it. I've learned about spring-boot that has helped me connect between docker, my program that i've made to get the secret code and my localhost. i've used it in oreder to complete the challange. after countless tries of recreating the project and changing and adjusting stuff i've managed to get the secret code using the program and put it on localhost:5000/secret. I then went on to the next challange which was the drone.io which is used to publish the container to the docker hub. then i've wrote another piece of code to publish the status,link for docker hub container and github project link and added it to the github.
